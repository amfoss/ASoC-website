                <strong>Why should I participate in amDeC?</strong>
                <p>
                  amDeC provides a platform for students to apply their skills
                  on real-world projects and learn along the way. You learn to
                  collaborate effectively and write code according to preset
                  standards. Whether you already know how to code, or have no
                  prior experience, amDeC is a perfect opportunity for you.
                  There are projects for people with any kind of skill set here.
                  You get to interact and share ideas with some great people. At
                  the end of it, you will have made some great friends from all
                  over the world with whom you can discuss fun projects, get
                  feedback on your code, and just about anything.

                <strong>Who can participate in amDeC?</strong>
                <p>
                  Any school / university student is eligible to participate in
                  amDeC.

                <strong>How do I participate in amDeC?</strong>

                  Students can participate by registering on the amDeC website.

                </strong>
                <p>
                  Students are selected on the basis of the final project
                  proposal sent by them before the deadline.

                </strong>
                <p>
                  Having prior coding knowledge is beneficial but not necessary.
                  You should just have the drive to keep learning new stuff as
                  you progress.
