## Topic - Android App Development

### Description 

Clean-up drives are one of the few major activities that are conducted quite frequently by Ayudh. As of now, there is no means to receive to updates about such events. 

This app allows its users to view all clean-up drive events along with all the checkpoints they will be covering. The users can also subscribe to notifications for a particular clean-up drive event.

The app currently only supports clean-up drive events. The app needs to support all events organised by Ayudh.
